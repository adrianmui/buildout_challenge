# Buildout Code Challenge

## By Adrian Mui

```
  if you want to run this locally you pretty much need access to buildout's api via my repo, buildout_api. you'll also need the key, which doesn't belong to me... 
  then run scripts, check package.json.. probably npm start
  the FE app is served on localhost:8080 or 8081 and calls my eb express layer... if it's not working then it probably means I haven't payed my aws bills.
```

### Express API:

http://buildoutapi.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/

Angular 2 with Express Server:

http://infinite-fortress-95462.herokuapp.com/ 

### If I had more time:

* Update my express api so that broker_id, second_broker_id, and third_broker_id would be under brokers: [ 9015, 9016, 9017]

* Pretty much everything in the UI/UX department. lol.

* Wrote this pretty much on little sleep and probably had some inconsistencies.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0.
